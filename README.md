# Cones Project
Program for simulating cones in a 3-dimension space and finding possible annihilation events.
### Build Instructions
This project was built using the Xcode's built-in gcc and g++ tools. \(Xcode ver. 11.3\)
### Usage Guide

### Current Goals
1. Determine a mathematical method for finding annihilation events between two cones. \(Then extended to any two cones within the space.\)
2. Design an interface for simulating cones.
3. Implement design for cone simulation.
4. Design function for finding annihilation events.
5. Implement function.
6. Unit testing.
